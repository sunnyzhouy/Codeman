## 0.3.5

### Patch Changes

- Fix Chrome "page unresponsive" crashes caused by xterm.js WebGL renderer GPU stalls during heavy terminal output. Disable WebGL by default (canvas renderer used instead), gate SSE terminal writes during tab switches, and add crash diagnostics with server-side breadcrumb collection.

## 0.3.4

### Patch Changes

- Fix Chrome tab freeze from flicker filter buffer accumulation during active sessions, and fix shell mode feedback delay by excluding shell sessions from cursor-up filter

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- fix: eliminate WebGL re-render flicker during tab switch by keeping renderer active instead of toggling it off/on around large buffer writes

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- Make file browser panel draggable by its header

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- LLM context optimization and performance improvements: compress CLAUDE.md 21%, MEMORY.md 61%; SSE broadcast early return, cached tunnel state, cache invalidation fix, ralph todo cleanup timer; frontend SSE listener leak fix, short ID caching, subagent window handle cleanup; 100% @fileoverview coverage

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- QR code authentication for tunnel access, 7-phase codebase refactor (route extraction, type domain modules, frontend module split, config consolidation, managed timers, test infrastructure), overlay rendering fixes, and security hardening

## 0.2.9

### Patch Changes

- System-level performance optimizations (Phase 4): stream parent transcripts instead of full reads, consolidate subagent file watchers from 500 to ~50 using directory-level inotify, incremental state persistence with per-session JSON caching, and replace team watcher polling with chokidar fs events

## 0.2.8

### Patch Changes

- Remove 159 lines of dead code: unused interfaces, functions, config constants, legacy no-op timer, and stale barrel re-exports

## 0.2.7

### Patch Changes

- Fix race condition in StateStore where dirty flag was overwritten after async write, silently discarding mutations
- Fix PlanOrchestrator session leak by adding session.stop() in finally blocks and centralizing cleanup
- Fix symlink path traversal in file-content and file-raw endpoints by adding realpathSync validation
- Fix PTY exit handler to clean up sessionListenerRefs, transcriptWatchers, runSummaryTrackers, and terminal batching state
- Fix sendInput() fire-and-forget by propagating runPrompt errors to task queue via taskError event
- Fix Ralph Loop tick() race condition by running checkTimeouts/assignTasks sequentially with per-iteration error handling
- Fix shell injection in hook scripts by piping HOOK_DATA via printf to curl stdin instead of inline embedding
- Narrow tail-file allowlist to remove ~/.cache and ~/.local/share paths that exposed credentials
- Fix stored XSS in quick-start dropdown by escaping case names with escapeHtml()

## 0.2.6

### Patch Changes

- Disable tunnel auto-start on boot; tunnel now only starts when user clicks the UI toggle

## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- Fix 3 minor memory leaks: clear respawn timers in stop(), clean up persistDebounceTimers on session cleanup, reset \_parentNameCache on SSE reconnect

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- Fix tunnel button not working: settings PUT was rejected by strict Zod validation when sending full settings blob; now sends only `{tunnelEnabled}`. Added polling fallback for tunnel status in case SSE events are missed.

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- Fix tunnel button stuck on "Connecting..." when tunnel is already running on the server

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- Update CLAUDE.md app.js line count references

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Integrate @changesets/cli for automated releases with changelogs, GitHub Releases, and npm publishing

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Initial public release with changesets-based versioning
